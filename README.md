## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind css

### What I learned

I learnt on toggling images for the humburger section and more responsive design tips and tricks.

### Continued development

I would like to perfect my responsiveness skill on images and the use of svg backgrounds and even on the icons.

### Useful resources

- [Image toggling](https://www.basedash.com/blog/how-to-change-an-image-src-with-javascript) - This helped me for learning how to toggle images using relative links and looked like dom manipulation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_items.asp) - I usually use this as my reference point for any code,css,html,js.

- [Grid blog](https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/) - a blog clearly explaining the grid column auto fit layout.
